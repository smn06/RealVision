# RealVision - Real-time Instance Segmentation

### Overview

RealVision is a powerful instance segmentation system designed for real-time video processing. This project aims to provide a robust solution for segmenting objects in live video streams, enabling applications such as object tracking, augmented reality, and scene understanding.

### Features

- **Real-time Segmentation:** Utilizing advanced computer vision techniques, RealVision ensures high-speed segmentation in real-time video.

- **Object Tracking:** The system allows for seamless object tracking, making it suitable for applications where the continuous identification of objects is crucial.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive interface facilitates easy integration and use, allowing developers to quickly implement instance segmentation in their projects.
